    Solving simple mathematical problems

        Now you should be able to construct a short program solving simple mathematical
            problems such as the Pythagorean theorem:

        The square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

a = 3.0
b = 4.0
c = (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5
print("c =", c)

"""
    NOTE

        We need to make use of the ** operator to evaluate the
            square root as:

            √ (x)  = x(½)

        and

            c = √ a2 + b2

    Go to LAB-5
